## Plugin architecture

#### Build process

- Add this `package.json` in the root of your plugin folder:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "watchify -vd -p browserify-hmr -e src/main.js -o index.js",
    "build": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production browserify -g envify -p [ vueify/plugins/extract-css -o index.css ] -p bundle-collapser/plugin -e src/main.js | uglifyjs -c warnings=false -m > index.js"
  },
  "browserify": {
    "transform": [
      "babelify",
      "vueify"
    ]
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "babel-core": "^6.26.3",
    "babel-plugin-transform-runtime": "^6.23.0",
    "babel-preset-env": "^1.7.0",
    "babelify": "^8.0.0",
    "browserify": "^16.2.2",
    "browserify-hmr": "^0.3.6",
    "bundle-collapser": "^1.3.0",
    "cross-env": "^5.2.0",
    "envify": "^4.1.0",
    "uglify-js": "^3.4.7",
    "vue": "^2.5.17",
    "vueify": "^9.4.1",
    "watchify": "^3.11.0"
  }
}
```

- Add a `.babelrc` in the root of your plugin folder:

```json
{
  "presets": [
    "env"
  ]
}
```

- Adjust your plugin's architecture:
  * Move what's within `index.js` to `src/main.js`. It will be automatically extracted.
  * Move what's within `index.css` to `<style>` tags in your JS components. It will be automatically extracted.

- Install `npm` if needed. Run `npm install` to get all dependencies.

- Use the following commands:
  * `npm run dev` when working on the plugin, live updates and hot-reload.
  * `npm run build` mandatory to publish your plugin. Will extract js and css.


#### Composer
To make a simple plugin installable with composer, you should create add a `composer.json` file to the plugin root. 

```json
{
  "name": "yourname/reponame",
  "description": "This description will be visible on packagist",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Your name",
      "email": "your@email.address"
    }
  ],
  "require": {
    "getkirby/cms": "*"
  },
  "license": "ISC",
  "autoload": {
    "files": [
      "index.php"
    ]
  }
}
```

The dependendy on `getkirby/cms` makes sure your plugin is loaded after kirby is loaded.

The repository you distribute on packagist.org must contain the compiled frontend files (index.js and index.css).  
If you prefer to not include dist files in your repository, you should consider using a CI service to automatically build and release your plugin. You can read more about this [here](release-zips-with-circleci.md). 

If your plugin is simple, doesn't rely on other composer packages or other php files this is all you need. Otherwise you should consider a [more advanced setup](composer-advanced.md).

## Fields

#### Work with your field's value

To work with your fieldâ€™s saved value you need a `value` prop in your `index.js`:

```javascript
props: {
    value: {
        type: [String, Boolean, Number, Object, Array]
    }
}
```

#### Tell Kirby there's new content to save

Having an 'input' method, that you call with `@input` will do most of the job:

```javascript
methods: {
    input(data) {
        this.$emit("input", data);
    }
}
```

In the template:

```html
<k-text-field v-model="value" name="seo" label="Boring text" @input="input"/>
```

## Multi-language

#### i18n

Worth mentioning: the localization plugin isn't `vue-i18n` but [vuex-i18n](https://github.com/dkfbasel/vuex-i18n). 
The syntax isn't the same, for example to pluralize strings:

```javascript
$t('pluralized.string', number) // vue-i18n, number is the 2nd argument
$t('pluralized.string', {}, number) // vuex-i18n, number is the 3rd argument
```

#### Listen to language change

Here's a snippet to get the current language code (remove `.code` to get the whole language object) and listen to page language change on multi-language websites:

```javascript
computed: {
    currentLanguage() {
        return this.$store.state.languages.current.code // returns en, fr, ...
    }
},
watch: {
    currentLanguage() {
        // do your thing
    }
},
```
